### Why 2 versions? ðŸŽ’

I made 2 versions of the knapsack problem, the first by using elitism, the second one without it.
Even if the 2 versions use the same identical parameters (except the ones regarding the Hall of Fame obviously) the version using elitism can often reach
the optimal solution (value of 1030) while the one that doesn't use it can't reach it and stops at  sub-optimal solutions with an average of 1000 value per solution
