# GAs_Exercises ðŸ§¬
This repository contains some of the most famous problems such as the OneMax problem, the n-queens problem and the travelling salesman problem. 
I resolved these problems with Genetic Algorithms as exercise
all the solutions are written in python and I used the DEAP python library using the Hands-On-Genetic-Algorithms-with-Python repository as a reference,
